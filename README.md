# Creating Access to Working Opportunities (CAWO)

## Empowering Professionals Through AI-Powered Resume Processing

### üåü Overview

Creating Access to Working Opportunities (CAWO) is a modern web platform that revolutionizes how professionals connect with employment opportunities. Built with a scalable Node.js/Express backend and a Next.js frontend, this platform leverages artificial intelligence to parse resumes, including voice-based submissions, making job searching more accessible and inclusive.

The platform represents a sophisticated implementation of modern web architecture principles, demonstrating how thoughtful system design can create real-world impact. By combining traditional document processing with cutting-edge AI capabilities from Hugging Face and voice transcription technologies, we've created a system that adapts to users' preferred methods of sharing their professional information.

### üéØ Core Features

#### 1. **Intelligent Resume Upload and Parsing**
Our platform goes beyond simple file storage. When users upload their resumes in PDF, DOC, or DOCX format, our system automatically extracts structured information using Hugging Face's question-answering models. This means employers can quickly search for candidates based on specific skills, experience levels, or educational backgrounds without manually reading through hundreds of documents.

#### 2. **Voice-Enabled Resume Creation**
Breaking down barriers for those who prefer speaking to writing, our voice resume feature allows users to record themselves describing their professional background. Using OpenAI's Whisper technology (via Hugging Face), we transcribe the audio and then apply the same intelligent parsing to extract structured data. This feature is particularly valuable for multilingual professionals who might be more comfortable speaking in their native language.

#### 3. **Secure Authentication System**
We've implemented a robust JWT-based authentication system that protects user data while providing a seamless experience. The system includes features like token refresh, secure password hashing with bcrypt, and session management, ensuring that sensitive professional information remains protected.

#### 4. **Real-Time Processing Pipeline**
Our asynchronous architecture ensures users don't have to wait for AI processing. When a resume is uploaded, the system immediately acknowledges receipt and processes the document in the background, notifying users when parsing is complete. This approach provides a responsive user experience even when dealing with compute-intensive AI operations.

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### üì° API Documentation

Our RESTful API follows industry best practices for clarity and consistency. Here are the key endpoints:

#### Authentication Endpoints

**User Registration**
```
POST /api/v1/users/register
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "SecurePassword123!",
  "username": "johndoe",
  "fullName": "John Doe"
}
```

**User Login**
```
POST /api/v1/users/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "SecurePassword123!"
}
```

Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>
```

### üß† AI Integration Architecture

The AI integration in this platform demonstrates sophisticated asynchronous processing patterns. When a resume is uploaded, here's what happens behind the scenes:

1. **File Reception:** The multer middleware validates the file type and size, then saves it with a unique identifier that includes the user ID and timestamp.

2. **Database Recording:** We immediately store metadata about the file in PostgreSQL, allowing users to see their upload history even before parsing completes.

3. **Asynchronous Processing:** The parsing task is delegated to a background function that won't block the API response. This ensures users get immediate feedback about their upload.

4. **AI Parsing Pipeline:**
  - First, we extract text from the PDF using pdf-parse
  - Then, we send targeted questions to Hugging Face's RoBERTa model
  - The model analyzes the text and extracts specific information like name, email, skills, and experience
  - We post-process the results to clean and structure the data

5. **Result Storage:** The parsed data is stored as JSON in PostgreSQL, taking advantage of its native JSON support for flexible querying.

### üîí Security Considerations

Security has been a primary concern throughout the development of this platform. Here's how we protect user data:

**Authentication Security:**
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with a cost factor of 10
- JWT tokens expire after 7 days and include user context
- All protected routes verify token validity before processing

**Input Validation:**
- File uploads are restricted by MIME type and file size
- All text inputs are sanitized to prevent injection attacks
- API endpoints validate request structure before processing

**Infrastructure Security:**
- Helmet.js adds security headers to all responses
- CORS is configured to accept requests only from trusted origins
- Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks on authentication endpoints

**Data Privacy:**
- Uploaded files are stored with anonymized filenames
- Database connections use SSL/TLS encryption
- Sensitive configuration is stored in environment variables, never in code

### üöÄ Deployment Considerations

When you're ready to deploy this application to production, here are key considerations:

**Database Scaling:**
Neon PostgreSQL provides automatic scaling, but you should monitor query performance and add indexes as the user base grows. The JSON storage for parsed data is flexible but might need optimization for complex queries.

**File Storage:**
While the current implementation stores files locally, production deployments should use cloud storage like AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage. This provides better scalability, redundancy, and CDN integration for global access.

**AI API Limits:**
Hugging Face has rate limits on their free tier. For production use, consider their paid plans or hosting their own inference endpoints for better control over processing speed and costs.

**Monitoring:**
Implement application monitoring using tools like New Relic or DataDog to track performance, errors, and usage patterns. This is crucial for maintaining a reliable service.

### üìö Architecture Decisions

Understanding why we made certain technical choices can help future contributors:

**Why Next.js + Express instead of Next.js API routes?**
We chose a separate Express backend to maintain clear separation of concerns and allow for independent scaling. This architecture also makes it easier to add microservices or migrate to different frontend frameworks in the future.

**Why PostgreSQL over MongoDB?**
While MongoDB might seem natural for storing JSON resume data, PostgreSQL's JSONB support gives us the flexibility of NoSQL with the reliability and query capabilities of a relational database. This is particularly important for complex searches across resume data.

**Why Hugging Face over other AI services?**
Hugging Face provides access to state-of-the-art models with a generous free tier, making it perfect for hackathon projects. Their inference API eliminates the need for GPU infrastructure while still providing production-quality results.
